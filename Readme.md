# What

The idea is to create a comprehensive DNA.css file filled with all your
variables and you use only the DNA when building your APP so you're consistent
in everything you do.

## Get Started

[Play around with it in codepen](https://codepen.io/lassediercks/pen/rYdjzm)

Or install our recommended dna.css in your project

```
npm install @kalispera/dna.css
yarn add @kalispera/dna.css
```

Or lint the rest of your project to prevent using something else than the
dns.css
